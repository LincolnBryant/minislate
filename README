MiniSLATE Install

NOTE: Host systems with Swap are currently unsupported, please run `swapoff -a` first. This is anticipated to change.

First install dependecies: Docker CE and Docker Compose

Docker CE on Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
Docker CE on CentOS: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/
Other operating systems are in the sidebar.

Docker Compose:
Use pip, install with your package manager.

Then: (sudo) pip install docker-compose

Inside the project directory run: ./start.sh

This will take a while. It is pulling dependencies and compiling the Slate project.

Ensure that the 'endpoint' and 'token' files in slate-config have 600 permissions and are owned by root.

When the process is complete you can issue commands from the slate client in a new terminal:

docker-compose exec slate slate ...(cluster list, vo list, etc)...

You can also just get a shell in the slate container with: docker-compose exec slate /bin/bash

To turn off the environment but not destroy it, run: docker-compose stop
Then turn it back on with: docker-compose start

To completely destroy the environment such that it can be created again with start.sh, run: ./purge.sh

The portal is accessible at https://localhost:5000/ on the host machine.
